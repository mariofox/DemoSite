 * This basic inventory service checks and adjusts the current inventory of a sku. All Skus will be considered 
 * generally unavailable from an inventory perspective if Sku.isAvaliable() returns false or if Sku.isActive() returns 
 * false.
 * 
 * Skus with an InventoryType of null or 'NONE' will be considered undefined from an inventory perspective, and will generally 
 * be considered available.  However, a request for available quantities of Skus with a null or 'NONE' inventory type will 
 * return null (as the sku is available but no inventory strategy is defined).
